We tested the correct entries to room E, A, H, C, and tested that the cells that weren't doors
are not recognized as doors. We also tested that walkways are not recognized as doors. This should ensure
the subtleties in the enumeration definitions.  We also tested the walkways/closets/rooms. Making sure to test
edges to ensure that functions work properly. Additionally testing the last/first cell was used to ensure
accurate functions. We selected cells by thinking about the most challenging pieces of the functions searching
for cells. Telling between doorway/walkway/closet, edges, different characters, and door directions.
